## Introduction

Humans on Earth face many health challenges. However, some of the most wide-spread sources of suffering and death are easily prevented or treated. Many cost-effective charities focus on delivering these interventions.

## How engineers can help

Many organizations such as [Engineers Without Borders](https://www.ewb-international.org/) are focused applying engineering talent to build and improve local infastructure.

Engineers can also help resolve logistical issues serving as bottlenecks to the delivery of effective health interventions such as [insecticide-treated bednets](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/bednets-have-prevented-450-million-cases-of-malaria).
