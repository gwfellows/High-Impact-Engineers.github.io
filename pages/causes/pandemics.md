## Introduction

Pandemics can cause substantial suffering and death. A sufficiently deadly and hard to detect or stop that it could decimate civilization. [Engineered pandemics](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/#catastrophic-ai-misuse) are a growing risk as biotech tools become more accessible.

## How engineers can help
Engineers can help build and deploy low-cost personal protective equipment (PPE) to arrest the spread of new diseases.

They also can help build technologies to reduce transmission in indoor spaces, such as [UV radiation](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ventilation/germicidal-ultraviolet/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcommunity%2Fventilation%2Fuvgi.html) or [propylene glycol](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10701621/).

Other avenues include the surveillance of new diseases, applying [tools such as metagenomics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-025-01223-5) to scan clinical, environmental, and wastewater samples, enabling the detection of unknown or emerging viral threats, and informing outbreak investigations.

Engineers can also assist in accelerating the development of new vaccines and treatments.
