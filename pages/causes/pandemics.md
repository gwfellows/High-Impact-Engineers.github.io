## Introduction

Pandemics can cause substantial suffering and death. It is even plausible that a pandemic could be sufficiently deadly and hard to detect or stop that it could cause human extinction.

## How engineers can help
Engineers can help build and deploy personal protective equipment (PPE) to arrest the spread of new diseases.

They also can help build technolgies to reduce transmittion in indoor spaces, such as [UV radiation](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ventilation/germicidal-ultraviolet/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcommunity%2Fventilation%2Fuvgi.html) or [propylene glycol](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10701621/)
