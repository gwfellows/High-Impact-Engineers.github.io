## Introduction

Humans are outnumbered by non-human animals in factory farms. These animals suffer under [horrible conditions](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/factory-farming/#treatment).

## How engineers can help

Most effective charities in the animal welfare space are focused on advocating for change in corporate and government policies. However, there is substantial room for engineers to steer technological development in a more humane direction

As an example of the success of engineering at creating progress in this area, in-ovo sexing.

Engineers can help alternative proteins and other meat alternatives, lessening demand for factory-farmed animals. Biomedical, chemical, mechanical, and industrial engineering are [all relevant](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hAl_qJdEA6yfvnX266RcOrUzFbeAa4uChioF-X2byCQ/edit?tab=t.0) in the alternative protein industry.

More speculatively, [gene editing could be used to improve animal welfare](https://www.vox.com/22994946/gene-editing-farm-animals-livestock-crispr-genetic-engineering)
