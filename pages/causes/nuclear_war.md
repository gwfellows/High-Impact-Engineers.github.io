## Introduction
Nuclear war remains a pressing existential risk. A full US-Russia exchange could kill hundreds of millions directly, followed by [nuclear winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_winter) potentially causing billions of famine deaths. These risks are highlighted by recent escalations (e.g., Ukraine, Taiwan tensions) and the field is still considered [neglected](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/cause-areas/long-term-future/nuclear-security), especially in private philanthropy, by Giving What we Can.

## How engineers can help

Engineers are critical in ensuring the security of nuclear systems. In governments, engineers are needed to [secure nuclear material](https://inl.gov/national-security/securing-nuclear-material/) and to create detection technologies to prevent the illicit production or movement of fissile material.

Organizations such as [allfed](https://allfed.info/) are working to ensure enough food could be produced to feed the world, even after a catastrophic event such as a nuclear winter. They are pursuing [many engineering pathways](https://allfed.info/?view=article&id=159:engineering&catid=20&highlight=WyJlbmdpbmVlcmluZyJd) to achieve this goal.
