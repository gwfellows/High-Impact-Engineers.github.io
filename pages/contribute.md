## Be active in the community

Join our [High Impact Engineers community](https://github.com/orgs/High-Impact-Engineers/discussions). Share your thoughts on existing discussions, or create a new one!

## Improve the website

This site has lots of room for improvement! You could

- update out-of-date articles (on cause areas, project ideas, or anything else)
<!-- - add a [BOLOHIP](./bolohip) entry -->
- fix typos
- suggest some nice design elements (logos, banners, colour schemes, etc.)
- improve the codebase (e.g. suggest CI/CD workflows)

Check out the [README](https://github.com/High-Impact-Engineers/High-Impact-Engineers.github.io/) for the website repo on GitHub for more details on how to contribute.

## Organise a meetup at an EAG

If you are going to an EA conference or a similar event, you could put on a meetup for engineers (if there isn't one already). Just message the organisers and ask if you can put something on the schedule.
