## What is BOLOHIP?

The Big Old List of High Impact Projects is a collection of promising projects to work on, with a bit of a focus on engineering projects.

## Why it might be a great idea

People can maybe find their next big project here. Anyone coming across a promising project can add it to the list and maybe someone will pick it up.

Some people struggle to find something great to work on. Others are overflowing with ideas but can't do them all. Maybe this list can help.

## Why it might not be a good idea

It could be a lot of work to keep this list and its contents up-to-date.

There might be a lot of low-quality projects on the list.

## How you could contribute

You can add a new project to this list by making a pull request. Check out the [README](https://github.com/High-Impact-Engineers/High-Impact-Engineers.github.io#readme) for details.
