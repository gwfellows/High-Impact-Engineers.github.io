## What is BOLOHIP?

The Big Old List of High Impact Projects is a collection of promising projects to work on, with a bit of a focus on engineering projects.

## Why it might be a great idea

Engineers can look for ideas for their next big project here. Anyone coming across a promising project can add it to the list and maybe someone will pick it up.

## Why it might not be a good idea

It could be a lot of work to keep up to date.

## How you could contribute

You can add a new project to this list by making a pull request. Check out the [Readme](https://github.com/High-Impact-Engineers/High-Impact-Engineers.github.io#readme) for details.
