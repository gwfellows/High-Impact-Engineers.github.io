High Impact Engineers was originally started by Jessica Wen and Sean Lawrence. It was founded in 2022. In 2024, the organisation lost funding.

High Impact Engineers is now completely volunteer-run and has no funding.

This website was built and is currently maintained by [Amanda Matthes](https://amanda-matthes.github.io/). Please help me change that by [contributing](./contribute.md) yourself! I would love to onboard more maintainers. But I am grateful for any tiny pull request and issue.
