One thing we hear a lot from do-gooding engineers is that they feel isolated in their desire to maximise their positive impact. We are working to change that, but it's early days!

## High Impact Engineers community

Come join our [High Impact Engineers community](https://github.com/orgs/High-Impact-Engineers/discussions) to discuss ideas, ask for advice, share your projects, and more!

## Other places to connect

Here is a list of other community spaces you might find useful:
- There is a `role-physical-engineers` channel on the [EA Anywhere Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/eavirtualmeetupgroup/shared_invite/zt-nnm9fyfp-kPS1R98d~SW5soPRcfegoQ).
- The [EA Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/) can also be a good place to connect with other people trying to do high-impact work. This isn't specifically for engineers, but it's a fairly active and helpful community.
